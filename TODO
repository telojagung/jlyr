/- ScrobbleDroidReceiver handle SAME_AS_CURRENT tracks better. What if it's a null SAME_AS_CURRENT?
- add more providers
- add more receivers
- allow to choose receivers (like in Simple Last.fm Scrobbler)
- main screen should display the name of now playing song
- maybe use database to save names of stored lyrics, to use search and/or load better in browser
- save in local file track info and provider/source. it should be displayed in the viewer
- add edit functionality to the saved lyrics.
- add canRead() and canSave() methods to providers, and provide the user with a choice to save there and there and read there and there. LyricReader will be a provider.
- use @color instead of @integer for colors?
/- do not try to fetch lyrics if there is no internet connectivity, as there will be tons of "an error occured!" toasts.
/- add a now playing button in search page, to fill the fields with the now playing track
/- add a menu option in Now playing page to search in web browser
- add search history
