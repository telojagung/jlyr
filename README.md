=== INSTALLING ===

Until it's on Google Play, you'll have to go through these steps:

To install, download the latest apk file from:
http://code.google.com/p/jlyr/downloads/list

Copy it on your device's SD Card and install it.
If that does not work, make sure you enable "Unknown Sources" in "Settings>Applications".

=== DEVELOPING ===

Do an svn checkout.
From Eclipse, go to "File>Import..." then "General>Existing Projects into Workspace".
If you get some errors, make sure you run "Project>Clean..." on the new project.

Contact me on (jadkik94 [at] gmail [dot] com) if you wish to contribute.
You know what TODO. :D

=== COPYING ===

Just take it. Do whatever you want to do with it. You are free.
Enjoy. :)
